1. it would be better to use websocket or something similar to have a real-time update on the price and recommendation
2. I think it should be the minimal.
3. do more caching, as the users would be requestsing the same data all the time; have a lot of host machines to handle the request
4. I would want to use more sources rather than just two, and would try to use websocket to get real-time data. And authentification.
